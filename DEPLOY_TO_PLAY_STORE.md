# Deploying InsureOS as a Mobile App (Google Play Store)

Since InsureOS is a modern Web Application, the best way to get it on the Google Play Store is using a **Trusted Web Activity (TWA)**. This wraps your PWA (Progressive Web App) into an Android App Bundle (.aab).

## Prerequisites

1.  **Deployed URL**: Your app must be live and secure (HTTPS). You have this: `https://insureos.vercel.app` (Example).
2.  **PWA Ready**: Your app must pass PWA criteria (Manifest, Service Worker, Icons). *We just configured this!*
3.  **Google Play Developer Account**: You need to pay the $25 one-time fee to Google.

## Step 1: Generate App Icons

You need two files in your `frontend/public` folder. You can generate these from your logo using a tool like [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

1.  `pwa-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
2.  `pwa-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Step 2: Use Bubblewrap (The Official Google Tool)

We will use `bubblewrap`, a CLI tool by Google, to turn your URL into an Android App.

1.  **Install Bubblewrap**:
    Open your terminal (outside the project or in a temp folder) and run:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Android Project**:
    Create a new folder for your mobile builds (e.g., `mobile-app`) and run:
    ```bash
    mkdir mobile-app
    cd mobile-app
    bubblewrap init --manifest https://insureos.vercel.app/manifest.webmanifest
    ```
    *(Note: Replace the URL with your actual Vercel URL. Bubblewrap will read the manifest we just created!)*

3.  **Answer the Prompts**:
    -   **Domain**: `insureos.vercel.app`
    -   **App Name**: InsureOS
    -   **PackageId**: `com.insureos.app` (or similar unique ID)
    -   **KeyStore**: Bubblewrap will ask to create a Java Keystore (signing key). **KEEP THIS FILE SAFE.** If you lose it, you can never update your app again.

4.  **Build the App**:
    ```bash
    bubblewrap build
    ```
    This will generate an `app-release-bundle.aab`.

## Step 3: Upload to Google Play Console

1.  Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
2.  **Create App**: Click "Create App". fill in "InsureOS", "Business", "Free".
3.  **Upload Bundle**: In the "Production" (or "Testing") track, upload the `.aab` file generated by Bubblewrap.
4.  **Digital Asset Links**:
    -   Google will give you a "Digital Asset Links" JSON snippet.
    -   You MUST host this file at `https://insureos.vercel.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.
    -   This proves you own the website.

## Step 4: Publish!

Once Google reviews your app (usually 1-3 days), it will be live on the Play Store! Users can install it, and because it's a TWA, **updates to your website (Vercel) automatically update the app content** immediately. No need to re-upload to Play Store for code changes (unless you change native icons/names).
